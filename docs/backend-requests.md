# Backend requests

The hand-off log from the frontend to the backend. When a Figma frame needs
something the content model or the queries do not provide, the frontend
**does not add it**; it is logged here and Kamindu changes the schema, the
migration and the projection together. See `docs/frontend-handbook.md`,
section "When the design needs something the data does not have".

One entry per request, newest at the bottom, numbered in order. Put
`{/* BACKEND-REQUEST #n: ... */}` at the spot in the code, and quote the
numbers in the PR. Kamindu fills in **Done** and flips the status; the
frontend then wires the field in and the entry stays as the record.

Status: `open` → `done` | `declined` (with a reason).

## #0 · done · 2026-09-08 · example entry

**Page / component:** `src/pages/[lang]/art-prize/[...tab].astro`, laureates tab
**Figma frame:** `119:65`
**The design shows:** a one-line subtitle under each laureate's name ("Winner of the Jury Prize 2026").
**The query returns today:** `getLaureates` → `artist.name`, `edition.year`, `statement`, `slideshow`; no subtitle.
**Rendered meanwhile:** name and year only.
**Done (Kamindu):** not a new field: it is `award.outcome` on the award that lists this laureate, now selected as `awards[]{title, outcome}` on each laureate in `getLaureates`. Render `awards[0].outcome`.
